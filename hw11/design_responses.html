					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> This article has taught me a lot about time durations for certain animations. I never really considered the different durations a designer would set based on the screen size. It makes a lot of sense to use all these different functionalities like easing, and not using motion blur to enhance the user experience. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The side by side comparisons of the good and bad examples were a great way to visually see the topics they were discussing. I did not know about half of these functionalities as I take so many UI designs for granted! It was very satisfying to see the graph with exponential growth be shown with circles on the side, also demonstrating the changes in speed. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. </p>
						</li>
