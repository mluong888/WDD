    <p> Hi, my name is Marvin. I am a third year at Cal, and studying CS! I love watching TV shows <br>
        (All time favorites prob would have to be Game of Thrones,
        The Office, How I Met Your Mother, etc). <br>
        Glad to be a part of this DeCal, and hope I eventually get to meet y'all. (:

    <h3>Original Wireframe: </h3>
    <img src = "assets/img/Screen Shot 2018-09-02 at 9.56.02 PM.png" alt = "my screen shot" height = 300 width = 400>
    <p> The goal of this website is to advertise my profile to other user on LinkedIn. <br>
        The design of LinkedIn's profile is very straight forward and clear who's profile you are looking at <br>
        It lists out all of the necessary details, like the person's name, where they work, position, etc.
    </p>
    <h3> New wireframe </h3>
    <img src = "assets/img/Screen Shot 2018-09-02 at 10.04.06 PM.png" alt = "dude idk" height=300 width=400>
    <p> I honestly didn't see any big issues with the original wireframe, but I decided to put the name text box <br>
        that was orginally below the profile photo in the same level as the photo so it is even more obvious <br>
        who the profile is of. The remaining details about the person's job, etc, I kept below the profile photo.
