                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article, I learned how creative some apps have gotten with the animation and transition to different screens. Having shapes scroll across, or the texture can really influence the feel of the user interface. It's crazy how we overlook these user interfaces in our daily lives, but so much thought goes behind each one! </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part was definitely going through all the examples and comparing their slick designs. It was very appealing to look at the creative designs in these applications. I never realized how pretty animations can make an application look.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I particularly liked Travel Map's user interface as it zooms out and has an interesting way of getting rid of results by breaking them down. The interface achieved it goal as the map needed to be zoomed out to show the entire path. In addition the "breaking down" of the text was a unique and creative way to get rid of the text. I also found the Shopping App Transitions very appealing to the eye, seeing the shapes fall into place. This is used to set the shapes of the borders and textboxes </p>
