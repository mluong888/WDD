							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about dark color variations and how those are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation. On the other hand, brighter color variations are made by increasing brightness and lowering saturation. I had never really thought about hues in colors, and learned that it shifts up and down with 3 maximum and minimum points along the graph. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed reading about the analysis of big known websites and how they utilize darker and lighter variations. It is interesting to analyze website that I use everyday, and I never really take notice of small details like color variation. It was also interesting to consider a shadow against a color scheme to be a darker variation. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> The truth is, so many variations in color between elements — or even states of the same element — are just simple color modifications.[The truth is, so many variations in color between elements — or even states of the same element — are just simple color modifications. </p>
