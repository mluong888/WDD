						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned many different concepts on why and how white space can improve a website. The article talks about how the white space can be used to catch the user's attention and emphasize certain items on the page. I never considered the Gestalt Principle of Proximity when creating a web page, but it definitely makes sense how objects close together would form a group. Before reading this article, I was also thinking that white space is a bit like wasted space, but I now see how white space has a big influence on the aesthetics and design .</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article would definitely be the side by side comparisons of the website/mobile app, showing direclty what influence white space can make. As a consumer, it is so easy to take these designs for granted because every website I use daily has a great design. It is very satisfying to see the "correct" version of the website with the spacing perfect and not so cluttered. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Medium knows whatâ€™s up."<br>
							 	"Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe."</p>
						</li>
