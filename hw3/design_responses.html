						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about Common Region principle, that elements in the same region are perceived as grouped. It was interesting to compare the pros and cons of having symmetrical elements and assymmetrical elements. I also learned the term multi-stability which is very applicable to things like optical illusions </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article would probably be the cool diagrams showing the four concepts of Gestalt's principles. I particularly enjoyed looking at the multi-stability images because I have always loved optical illusions with multiple hidden messages. I thought reification was also an intersting concept that I had never thought about. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
