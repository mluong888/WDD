							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> I didn't realize how many different types of attention there are! I thought it was really interesting to analyze the different types of attention and the article does a great job explaining with examples about how they differ.  When designing a website, I will keep these concepts in mind, making sure I do not overwhelm the user and can try to grasp their focused attention. I thought the driving and talking was a great analogy to represent divided attention as it is very applicable to my daily life. </p>
